# GeoQuiz
Currently the user takes a quiz and after completion, the user gets the score in standard percent format as a Toast. The user can answer the questions in any order (and can go backward and forward between them) and once the user answers a question, a True or False Toast appears based on the answer and then the buttons for that question become unclickable. 

This app is in its early stages and the goal is to make it much more complex and with better graphics.
